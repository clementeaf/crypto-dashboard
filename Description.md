ðŸ§ª Take-Home Programming Exercise: Crypto Dashboard
Estimated Time: 3â€“4 hours

Tech Stack: Remix + React

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a simple, dynamic cryptocurrency dashboard using Remix and React that allows users to view, sort, and filter a list of cryptocurrencies. The dashboard should display real-time exchange rate data pulled from the Coinbase API.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements
1. Cryptocurrency Card Layout
Display a list of at least 10 cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) in a responsive card-based layout.
Each card must include:
The cryptocurrency name and symbol
Current exchange rate to USD
Current exchange rate to Bitcoin (BTC)
2. Dynamic Data Fetching
Use the Coinbase API (or a suitable public endpoint) to fetch real-time exchange rates.
The rates should be updated on page load, and optionally allow for manual refresh or auto-refresh.
3. Drag & Drop Reordering
Users should be able to drag and drop cards to reorder the list.
The order should persist while the user remains on the page.
4. Filtering
Provide a filter input at the top of the page.
Users can type to filter the list by name or symbol (e.g., typing "eth" should show Ethereum).
âœ… Bonus (Optional)
These are not required, but will earn extra points:

Persist card order to localStorage
Add a dark/light mode toggle
Include loading and error states
User authentication
Unit tests
ðŸ“¦ Submission Guidelines
Share your project via GitHub.
Include a short README with:
Setup instructions
Notes on decisions or tradeoffs you made
ðŸ§  What Weâ€™re Looking For
Clean, modular, and idiomatic React + Remix code
Clear and maintainable styling and layout
Ability to integrate with APIs and handle async data
UX polish: loading states, error handling, responsiveness
